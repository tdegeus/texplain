# texplain

Collect only included TeX-files, figures, and references in an output directory.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
texplain INPUT.TEX OUTPUT-PATH

# Getting help
texplain --help
```

Copy the TeX-file and only those figure-files and references that are included in it to a separate folder. This is particularly useful to create a clean version to submit to a journal.
